"Introducing FontPhantom: the ingenious tool that elegantly transforms your text into outlines while meticulously annotating your layers with the original font names, enriching your Adobe Illustrator workflow with a detailed record of your design evolution."


Step-by-step instructions on how to use the FontPhantom tool:

1. **Download FontPhantom:** Start by downloading the FontPhantom tool from the official website or the source provided.

2. **Save the Script:** Once downloaded, save the `.js` file to a convenient location on your computer. You'll need to locate this file from within Adobe Illustrator, so a location like your Desktop or a specific Scripts folder could be beneficial.

3. **Open Adobe Illustrator:** Launch Adobe Illustrator and open the document you wish to work on. 

4. **Backup Your Work:** Before running any script, it's always a good idea to save a copy of your work. This way, if something unexpected happens, your original work is safe.

5. **Run FontPhantom:** To run the script, go to the menu bar at the top of the screen. Click "File", then navigate to "Scripts" -> "Other Script...". A file explorer window will open.

6. **Locate the Script:** In the file explorer window, navigate to where you saved the FontPhantom `.js` file. Click on it and then click "Open". The FontPhantom script will now run on your active Illustrator document.

7. **Check Your Layers:** After the script has finished running, you'll notice new layers in your Layers panel. These layers will be named after the original fonts of the text objects that were outlined.

Remember, the FontPhantom tool doesn't move the outlined text into the new layers. Instead, it creates these layers as a detailed record, leaving you with notes on your original design choices. Use these layers as references for future design decisions or to keep track of your project's evolution. 

Enjoy using FontPhantom and happy designing!
